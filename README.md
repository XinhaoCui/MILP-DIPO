2.Overview‚ú®

The optimization of workforce scheduling and routing problems (**WSRPs**) with a focus on timeliness-oriented rush repair in logically complex systems has received extensive attention because of the escalating degree and frequency of both natural and anthropogenic disasters. As there are many characteristics of complex system rush-repair, such as wide distribution but complex logical correlations, limited repair time, and different criticality levels, conventional approaches, such as distance priority, exhibit shortcomings in terms of timeliness (i.e., a comprehensive indicator that integrates both timely and mission reliability).

To improve the overall emergency response efficiency under uncertain disaster scenarios, we develop a general timeliness-oriented decision-making framework for rush-repair WSRP. An optimization model is then formulated based on integer linear programming to maximize the overall rush-repair timeliness while satisfying the skill-matching requirements and system-level recovery constraints. 

Furthermore, a novel **matheuristic algorithm** (i.e., the interoperation of metaheuristic and mathematical programming technique) is proposed as a general solution approach for rush-repair decision-making under serialized system disruption scenarios. Finally, diverse benchmark groups, including different scales and sparsity levels, are simulated to conduct computational experiments. Compared to several representative algorithms, the results show that the proposed method has strong robustness and high efficiency.

6.Experimental environmentüî®

The MIP solver AMPL/CPLEX (version 12.6.0.1) was used to solve the proposed MILP model using the synthesized problem instances. Computational experiments were performed on a PC server with two 2.30 GHz Intel 32 Core Processors and 128 GB of memory.
